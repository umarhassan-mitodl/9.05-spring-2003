Presentations on Readings
-------------------------

Students make two class presentations during semester, based on the assigned readings.

Mini-Proposal and Presentation
------------------------------

Students write a 5-page mini-proposal on how to perform an experiment to either test a new theory or disprove an old, accepted paradigm.

The proposals areÂ presented in class. Students must be prepared to defend their ideas and make an argument for why they think their approach would work.
