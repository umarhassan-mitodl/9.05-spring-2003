Course Overview
---------------

Introduction

**Issue 1: What is Controlled?**

*   Striated muscles (n=640)
*   Tendons
*   Bones
*   Joints
*   Soft tissue
*   \+ Smooth muscles
*   \+ Glands

Distinction Between Voluntary and Involuntary Movements:

*   Reflexes
*   Example: patellar reflex (myotatic reflex)
*   Is a knee jerk not voluntary?
*   Modulation of reflexes
*   Jendrassik maneuver
*   Suppression of reflexes

External:

*   Visual
*   Auditory

**Issue 2: Cues Used by the Nervous System**

*   Reflexes
*   Example: patellar reflex (myotatic reflex)
*   Is a knee jerk not voluntary?
*   Modulation of reflexes
*   Jendrassik maneuver
*   Suppression of reflexes

External:

*   Visual
*   Auditory
*   Touch/Pressure
*   Pain
*   Gravity
*   Receptors
*   Olfactory

Internal:

*   Proprioreceptors
*   Receptors in muscles, tendons, fascia and ligaments
*   Learned triggers
*   S    R
*   UCS    UCR
*   (Si + UCS)n    Si    Ri
*   Intention
*   Cognitive Control

**Issue 3: Cues Used by the Nervous System** **to Control Movements**

*   Sensorimotor, mnemonic, and cognitive
*   Example of the language system

**Issue 4: Levels of Analysis**

Level I:

*   Emotion/Cognition
*   Grapho-Motor System
*   Motor-Speech System
*   Auditory System
*   Visual System
*   Writing Speaking Hearing Reading
*   Formulation

Language System:

*   Working
*   Memory
*   Comprehension
*   Serial model of motor control
*   Computations required by serial model of motor control
*   Feed-forward / feedback control

**Issue 5: What is Computed and How?**

Serial Model of Motor Control:

*   Definitions

Kinematics:

*   Change in position, for example, of limb over time. Could specify in terms of timedependent changes in joint angle.

Dynamics:

*   Patterns of forces associated with the movements – joint torques.
*   Assume you visually specify object position with respect to the body. To reach it, is then necessary to compute:
    *   Inverse kinematics: Compute the joint angle to get the finger to the target.
    *   Inverse dynamics: Given desired target position and kinematics, compute the forces needed to get the arm there.
*   Computations required by serial model of motor control
*   Feed-forward / feedback control
*   E.g. touch X
*   Eye in head
*   Head on trunk
*   Arm on trunk
*   Arm joints / hand
*   Egocentric
*   Center scan
*   Retinotopic
*   Object centered?

**Issue 6: Spatial Coordinate Frames Used for** **Sensorimotor Control**

*   Cerebral cortex
*   Basal ganglia
*   Cerebellum
*   Brainstem
*   Spinal cord

**Issue 7: What Brain Regions are Involved in** **Motor Control?**

*   Stimulation
*   Ablation / human clinicopath correlations
*   Anatomy of connections
*   Animal studies
*   Reflexes
*   Locomotion
*   Behavioral patterns
*   Gene-based studies

**Issue 8: What Techniques are Used to Study** **Motor Control?**

*   Degrees of freedom problem
*   Serial order of behavior
*   Sensory / perceptual motor transform
*   Motor equivalence
*   Motor learning and plasticity
*   Higher order control: cognition, motivation
*   Computational models

**Issue 9: Challenges for the Field**

*   3DF

Degrees of Freedom Problem:

*   1DF
*   DF
*   DF 3DF at wrist
*   2DF

Degrees of Freedom Problem:

1.  Plan ahead
2.  Minimize jerk (da/dt)
3.  Built-in synchronies (e.g. “associated movements”)
4.  “Too complicated so can’t be done so we don’t do it” (Alexander + Crutcher)
5.  End point calculations vs. trajectory calculations

Possible Solutions to the Degrees of Freedom Problem:

*   Speech
*   Complex actions
*   Milk in cupboard
*   Cereal box in fridge
*   Co-articulation
*   Fingers move ahead – not in order of letters to be typed – as in “an epic”
*   Modularity?
*   Chunking?

**Sample Lecture Outline for Lecture 5:** **Motor Cortex**

Primary Motor Cortex

*   M1 has body map
*   But controversy about maps is coming...
*   Wilder Penfield experiments
*   Microelectrode stimulation-recording experiments (Asanuma)
*   Multiple motor areas in addition to M1

Role of the Pyramidal Track

*   Anatomy of the Pyramidal Track (origin and destination)
*   Stroke
*   Privileged access to motor neurons in spinal cord
*   Kuypers' experiments (transsection of pyramidal tract vs.. reticular spinal tracts)
*   Paradox of one PT neuron innervates motor neurons for multiple motor neuronal pools

What is Coded by M1 Neurons?

*   Breakthrough with experimental protocol introduced by Edward Everets (1960's)
*   M1 neurons code for load - early story
*   M1 neurons have a population code for direction of movement (Georgopoulos experiments)
*   Population vectors

M1 Map/Representation is Highly Plastic.

*   Laboratory evidence (Nudo)
*   Evidence from human scans

What M1 Neurons Respond to is not Simply Related to Corresponding Muscle EMG Activity.

*   Different conditions producing EMG activity in a single muscle may not all induce spike activity in a motor neuron connected to that muscle.

The Hypothesis that Different Motor Cortical Areas Specialize in Different Aspects of Movement.

*   "Simple" movements
*   Sequential movements
*   Imagined movements
